# Autobake plugin for CakePHP

## Installation

You can install this plugin into your CakePHP application using [composer](http://getcomposer.org).

The recommended way to install composer packages is:

```
composer require ivyhjk/Autobake
```
# autobake

Autobake can "auto-generate" all your models, controllers and views from a given database, previously established in your App/config/app.php file.

- It's based on Bake console, but better.
- Support table prefixes
